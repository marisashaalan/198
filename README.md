# 198
I’ve taken Gene Sharp’s 198 Methods and formatted them in a JSON schema that maintains continuity with the 1973 original text. I’ve integrated recent updates to the original, including methods informed by recent and developments, like the internet and social media.  

I intend this to be an all-purpose JSON file, supporting the development of video tagging and analysis applications. Its goal is to provide a common vocabulary for tagging based on primary source material, find and identify patterns in visually recorded human behavior during moments of social contention. 
Sources: Consolidated taxonomy consists of two taxonomies cleaned up, combined, and integrated using Grok 3.0 prompts. 

The schema sources:
Albert Einstein Institute: “198 METHODS OF NONVIOLENT ACTION” https://www.brandeis.edu/peace-conflict/pdfs/198-methods-non-violent-action.pdf
ICNC: “Civil Resistance Tactics in the 21st Century”, https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Civil-Resistance-Tactics-in-the-21st-Century-Monograph.pdf![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0183752-c9bd-4bb2-98a4-bd53f7d7f87a)
